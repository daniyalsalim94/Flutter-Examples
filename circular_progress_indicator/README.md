## How to implement a CircularProgressIndicator

- Use the code below to implement a CircularProgressIndicator

```

              CircularProgressIndicator(
                value: progress,
                backgroundColor: Colors.amber[100],
                valueColor: AlwaysStoppedAnimation<Color>(Colors.blue),
